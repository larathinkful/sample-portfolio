        <h2> About Lara </h2>
        <div>
        <p>
         After graduating college, I started working in management first in a restaurant chain in the Chicago area and later in a convenience store in the Madison area. 
         With both companies, I travelled and worked at multiple locations, trained new coworkers, and worked my way up. However, I felt like what I was doing was not stimulating
         enough in the right ways for me and I found myself looking for another career path. </p>
        <p> As a student at <a href="thinkful.com">Thinkful,</a> I've begun my journey to becoming a software engineer and I am really enjoying the change! </p>
        <p> If you're looking to hire a new developer, please reach out! I am looking forward to working with other developers to build great software and continue honing my coding skills. </p>
